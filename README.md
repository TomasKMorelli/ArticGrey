Hello Articgrey team ðŸ‘‹,

This document outlines the technical process I followed to bring this headless Shopify project to life. From environment setup to deployment, I immersed myself in Shopifyâ€™s ecosystem and its Hydrogen framework to build a fast, scalable storefront tailored to your needs.


ðŸ›  Technical Workflow
Step-by-step breakdown of my development workflow:

Created a Development Store
Registered a free Shopify Partner account and generated a development store with mock data for testing and integration purposes.

Installed the Headless Channel
Installed Shopifyâ€™s Headless sales channel via the admin panel to enable Hydrogen integration and access Storefront API credentials.

Initialized GitHub Repository
Set up a new Git repository and connected it to GitHub for version control and collaboration.

Generated Hydrogen Project
Used npm create @shopify/hydrogen@latest to scaffold a Hydrogen project with Remix, Tailwind CSS, and TypeScript support.

Installed Shopify CLI
Installed the official Shopify CLI to run local development, preview the app, and manage configurations.

Configured Environment Variables
Created a .env file with the necessary API credentials and store domain, enabling secure GraphQL access.

Launched the Project Locally
Installed all dependencies and ran the project using npm install and npm run dev.

Connected to Shopify via GraphQL
Implemented Shopify Storefront API queries using GraphQL to fetch products, collections, and other storefront data dynamically.

Pushed Code to GitHub
Committed all changes and pushed the project to the connected GitHub repository for versioning and collaboration.

Deployed on Vercel
Used Vercel for deploying the Hydrogen project with a custom domain, enabling fast performance and global reach.

ðŸ§° Technologies Implemented
Shopify CLI â€“ Project scaffolding, developer commands, environment setup.

Hydrogen + Remix + TypeScript â€“ Headless storefront architecture with modern tooling.

GraphQL â€“ Used to perform structured queries to the Storefront API.

Tailwind CSS â€“ For responsive, utility-first UI styling.

Headless Channel â€“ Essential bridge to connect Hydrogen with Shopify's backend.

Figma + Locofy.ai â€“ Used for fast design-to-code translation and layout prototyping.

ðŸš€ Technical Concepts and Learnings
Throughout the development process, I dove deep into Shopifyâ€™s headless structure and adopted best practices to build a maintainable, component-driven architecture. Some of the key highlights:

Component Reusability â€“ All UI components are modular, reusable, and structured for scalability.

Remix Loaders â€“ Implemented server-side loaders for efficient data fetching and seamless user experience.

Dynamic "Add to Cart" Button â€“ Built a custom, interactive Add to Cart component with conditional logic and purchase option dropdowns.

GraphQL API Handling â€“ Integrated robust queries with proper error handling and loading states.

Responsive Design â€“ Followed mobile-first best practices with pixel-accurate layout matching based on Figma designs.
